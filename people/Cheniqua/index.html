    <p>Hello! I am new to Web Development. Previously, I was a full time baker and have worked in bars and foodservice most of my life. I also currently work in
    a karaoke bar! I am hoping to make a switch to the tech industry for better work/life balance and have hopes of combining my new found skills with music or gaming! </p>
