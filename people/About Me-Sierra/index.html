                <p>Kayaking is my favorite water sport. I could spend hours paddling around a lake, looking at the sky. I also love floating down streams with my friends.</p>

                <p>When I want to feel grounded, I take hikes. Walking through nature brings me a peace. I hike throughout the greater Cincinnati area and northern Kentucky at least twice a week.</p>

            <div class="card-text">
                <p>Yup, that's me... The first concert I went to was Taking Back Sunday at the Thompson House. I was hooked to live music ever since. I have been to every Warped Tour in Cincinnati, starting at the age of 13 (BRING IT BACK please). Now I work at SGHR where I have seen my favorite band, Margot and the Nuclear So & So's. "Don't stop me now", this Saturday I'm going to Chappell Roan live FOR 10 DOLLARS. Can you believe it!?</p>
