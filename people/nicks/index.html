                a Bachelor's in Biology from Eastern Kentucky University. I'm passionate and curious about web development.</p>

                            <p>Been a fan of Star Trek all my life. I remember 
                                watching TNG when I was a kid with my dad. Fell in love
                            with Voyager in high school. Been a huge trekkie since.</p>

                            <p>Started weight lifting a couple years ago and I love how it
                                makes me feel. I feel strong, capable and focused. There's 
                                something really incredible about focusing just on lifting something
                                heavy and putting it back down again.

                            <p>My first video game was the original Age of Empires when I was a kid.
                                Started playing SimCity after that. Really got into gaming in my early 
                                teens. It's been a bit of an addiction since then.

                            <h2>Baking</h2>
                            <p>I love baking and experimenting with new dishes. I've baked cakes,
                                cinnamon rolls, brioche, macrons, gingerbread cookies and much more! 
                                I love trying out new difficult recipes and figuring out how to get them right.
